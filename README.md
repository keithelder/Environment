Environment

# What is WindowsEnvironment
It is my attempt to automate as much setup and configuration as I can when I need to setup a new Windows computer 
for either personal use or for .NET development. 

# Setup
If you are a .NET develper, run InstallEverything.bat to setup everything all at once. 

If you are just setting up a personal machine run InstallChocaltey.bat and then InstallUtils.bat.
