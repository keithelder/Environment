Windows Environment Setup Tool
===========

# What is WEST
WEST is my attempt to automate setting up a Windows PC as much as I can. As a developer I have many different computers and 
VMs whereby I wind up performing the same setup tasks over and over. WEST is a set of scripts and in the future an app that will help 
setup and configure a new Windows computer via a saveable configuration file which will allow different configurations 
to be saved and loaded and customized and stored in the Cloud. 

# Setup
Today the setup just supports a set of install scripts. 

If you are a .NET develper, run InstallEverything.bat to setup everything all at once. 

If you are just setting up a personal machine run InstallChocaltey.bat and then InstallUtils.bat. 

# What Dev Tools Get Installed

* Fiddler
* LINQPad
* Git
* Poshgit
* 

# Which Utils Get Installed

* Putty (for ssh)
* Notepad++
* 7Zip
* Ditto (copy paste tool)
* Lastpass
* Vim

# Future
Right now WEST is just a set of scripts. But it will be expanded to more of a tool. Please join in the project if you are interested.
